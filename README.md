# PersonalVimiumHotkeys
Starting with a fascination with Vim, I'm attempting to make a mouse-lite desktop as new user friendly as possible (keeping a Vim feel). I've found Vimium to effectively make my regular brave-browser config for the most part mouse free, just using it for selecting text. Check the repo for the key-map file which you should just be able to copy straight into Vimium.

ps. Browsers frequently has hidden hotkeys which are not easily configurable (especially in Brave's case where it doesn't have all the abilities of modern Chrome). So sometimes when you when you rebind a key for Vimium and use it, you'll find it perform a different task (in my case: Brave - Chromium - has Ctrl+W bound to force close Brave, fun). With this in mind I've dodged all the global hotkeys, even though I realize you can turn these off in settings or use a different keymapping extension.
