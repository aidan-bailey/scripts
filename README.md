# PersonalVimiumHotkeys
Starting with a fascination with Vim, I'm attempting to make a mouse-lite desktop as new user friendly as possible (keeping with the hjkl feel). I've found Vimium to effectively turn my regular brave-browser config mouse-free for the most part. Check the repo for the key-map file which you should just be able to copy straight into Vimium.

ps. Browsers frequently have hidden hotkeys which are not easily configurable (especially in Brave's case where it doesn't have all the abilities of modern Chrome). So sometimes when you when you rebind a key for Vimium and use it, you'll find it perform a different task (in my case: Brave - Chromium - has Ctrl+W bound to force close a tab). With this in mind I've tried dodged all the global hotkeys, even though it's possible to turn these off in settings or using different keymapping extension.
